## Resume Builder 9000 - Chat Archive (2025-09-22)

### Summary

- Focus: Preventing hardcoded test/mock data in production, strict TypeScript, ESLint custom rule/plugin, SonarQube-driven refactor, code quality, and coverage improvements.
- Key actions: Custom ESLint rule, plugin packaging, test/mocks isolation, ADR migration, workspace script warnings silenced, config file exclusions, high-complexity function refactor, helper extraction, and unit test coverage.
- Outcome: Helpers moved to utils, direct unit tests added, all tests pass, code quality and maintainability improved.

### Key Files

- `apps/web/src/app/resume-upload/page.tsx`: Refactored, helpers extracted
- `apps/web/src/app/resume-upload/resume-upload-utils.ts`: New, testable helpers
- `apps/web/tests/unit/resume-upload-utils.test.ts`: New, direct unit tests for helpers
- `apps/web/tests/unit/BuildPageImpl.tsx`: Provided for context

### Notable Decisions

- Custom ESLint rule enforced via plugin, config overrides for test/mocks and config files
- All test/mocks isolated from production code
- ADRs split into individual files
- SonarQube complexity refactor: helpers extracted, coverage improved

### Technical Debt & Next Steps

- Ensure custom ESLint rule is always resolvable in all environments
- Continue to improve test coverage for all utility logic
- Monitor for further SonarQube/code quality issues
