# Architectural Decision Records

## Purpose

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) document the key architectural decisions made during the development of the `resume-builder-9000` project. Each decision includes the context, the decision itself, and the consequences of the decision.

---

## ADR 1: Monorepo Structure

### Context (ADR 1)

The project consists of multiple components, including a frontend, backend, and shared core logic. Managing these components in separate repositories would increase complexity in dependency management and versioning.

### Decision (ADR 1)

Adopt a monorepo structure using workspaces to manage all components in a single repository. This allows for easier dependency management, consistent versioning, and streamlined development workflows.

### Consequences (ADR 1)

- **Positive**: Simplified dependency management, consistent versioning, and easier cross-component changes.
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in repository management and potential for larger repository size.

---

## ADR 2: SQLite for Database

### Context (ADR 2)

The project requires a lightweight, file-based database solution for storing resumes and related data. The database should be easy to set up and maintain without requiring a dedicated database server.

### Decision (ADR 2)

Use SQLite as the database for the project. SQLite is lightweight, easy to integrate, and sufficient for the project's data storage needs.

### Consequences (ADR 2)

- **Positive**: Simple setup, minimal maintenance, and no need for a separate database server.
- **Negative**: Limited scalability and concurrency compared to more robust database solutions.

---

## ADR 3: Next.js for Frontend

### Context (ADR 3)

The frontend requires server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities for improved SEO and performance. The framework should also support modern development practices and integrate well with the backend.

### Decision (ADR 3)

Use Next.js for the frontend application. Next.js provides SSR, static site generation (SSG), and a rich ecosystem for modern web development.

### Consequences (ADR 3)

- **Positive**: Improved SEO, better performance, and a modern development experience.
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in deployment and potential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Next.js.

## ADR 4: Next.js and Node.js Versions

### Context (ADR 4)

The project requires a stable and modern version of Next.js to leverage its latest features, such as app routing and server-side rendering. Additionally, the Node.js version must be compatible with Next.js and other project dependencies. The choice of versions impacts the ESLint setup, as certain rules and plugins may require specific versions of Next.js and Node.js.

### Decision (ADR 4)

- Use **Next.js v15** to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.
- Use **Node.js v22+** for its stability, long-term support, and compatibility with Next.js v15.
- Update the ESLint configuration to include the `eslint-plugin-next` plugin, ensuring compatibility with Next.js v15 features and best practices.

### Consequences (ADR 4)

- **Positive**:
  - Access to modern Next.js features, such as app routing and improved server-side rendering.
  - Stability and long-term support with Node.js v22+.
  - Improved code quality and adherence to Next.js best practices through the updated ESLint setup.
- **Negative**:
  - Developers must use Node.js v22+ or higher, which may require updates to local development environments.
  - Potential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Next.js v15 features.

## ADR 5: Enforce Strict TypeScript Types and Type Safety

### Context (ADR 5)

During Copilot code review and architectural discussions, it became clear that enforcing strict type safety in TypeScript would significantly improve maintainability, reliability, and developer experience. Type safety helps catch errors early, improves code readability, and enables better tooling and refactoring support. Copilot review specifically recommended true types and strict type annotations across the codebase.

### Decision (ADR 5)

Adopt strict TypeScript type enforcement throughout the codebase. All modules, functions, and APIs must use explicit and accurate type annotations. The TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) is set to strict mode, and CI checks will fail if type errors are present.

### Consequences (ADR 5)

- **Positive**: Improved code quality, fewer runtime errors, better IDE/tooling support, easier refactoring, and more robust APIs.
- **Negative**: Slightly increased development overhead, stricter CI, and a learning curve for developers less familiar with advanced TypeScript features.

## Future ADRs

- Document decisions related to CI/CD pipelines.
- Record decisions about third-party integrations and libraries.
- Include decisions about scaling and performance optimization.
