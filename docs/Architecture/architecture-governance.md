# Architecture Governance

## Purpose

Architecture governance ensures that the architectural integrity of the `resume-builder-9000` project is maintained throughout its lifecycle. It establishes processes, roles, and tools to ensure consistency, scalability, and alignment with business goals.

---

## Governance Principles

1. **Consistency**: Ensure all components adhere to the defined architectural patterns and principles.

2. **Scalability**: Design for growth, ensuring the architecture can handle increased load and complexity.

3. **Security**: Follow secure coding practices and regularly review for vulnerabilities.

4. **Collaboration**: Foster communication between teams to ensure alignment and shared understanding.

5. **Adaptability**: Allow for iterative improvements and evolution of the architecture.

## Governance Roles

### 1. Architecture Owner

- Responsible for overall architectural decisions.

- Ensures alignment with business goals.

- Reviews and approves major architectural changes.

### 2. Development Leads

- Ensure team adherence to architectural guidelines.

- Provide feedback on architectural decisions.

- Identify areas for improvement.

### 3. QA and Security Teams

- Validate that implementations align with architectural principles.

- Conduct regular security and performance audits.

## Governance Processes

### 1. Architectural Reviews

- Conduct regular reviews to ensure adherence to architectural principles.

- Include stakeholders from development, QA, and operations teams.

### 2. Decision Records

- Maintain Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document key decisions.

- Ensure ADRs are accessible and up-to-date.

### 3. Code Reviews

- Enforce architectural guidelines during code reviews.

- Use automated tools to validate compliance with coding standards.

### 4. Continuous Improvement

- Regularly evaluate the architecture for potential improvements.

- Incorporate feedback from teams and stakeholders.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **ESLint**: Enforce coding standards and architectural rules.

- **Vitest**: Ensure robust testing of architectural components.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate checks for architectural compliance.

- **Monitoring Tools**: Track performance and identify bottlenecks.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Define metrics to measure architectural compliance and performance.

- Automate architectural reviews using advanced tools.

- Establish a knowledge-sharing platform for architectural best practices.

## Naming & Typing Policies

- **Type Safety & API Contracts:** see `typing-and-api-contracts.md` for explicit return types, strict compiler settings, and lint enforcement.
- **Naming & Ubiquitous Language (DDD):** see `naming-and-ubiquitous-language.md` for domain-driven naming, allowed acronyms, and folder/file patterns.
