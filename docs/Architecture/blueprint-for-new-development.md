# Blueprint for New Development

## Purpose

This blueprint provides a guide for implementing new features in the `resume-builder-9000` project. It includes workflows, templates, and best practices to ensure consistency, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Request**:
   - Document the feature requirements in a ticket or issue.
   - Include user stories, acceptance criteria, and any relevant diagrams.

2. **Design Phase**:
   - Review the architectural impact of the feature.
   - Update Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) if necessary.
   - Create mockups or prototypes if applicable.

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Follow the projectâ€™s coding standards and architectural guidelines.
   - Write self-explanatory code with minimal comments.
   - Ensure proper modularization and adherence to the architectural layers.

4. **Testing Phase**:
   - Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
   - Ensure 100% test coverage for critical components.
   - Use Vitest for testing and validate results in CI/CD pipelines.

5. **Code Review**:
   - Submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description of changes.
   - Address feedback promptly and ensure all checks pass.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Follow the deployment architecture guidelines.
   - Test the feature in staging before deploying to production.

   - Use ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent code style.
   - Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant documentation for new features.
   - Use markdown templates for consistency.

3. **Performance**:
