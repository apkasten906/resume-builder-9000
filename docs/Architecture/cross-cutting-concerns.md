# Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Implementation**:
  - Authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
  - Authorization is role-based, with roles defined in the database.

- **Patterns**:
  - Middleware is used to validate JWTs and enforce role-based access control.
  - Secure cookies are used to store tokens for client-side sessions.

## Error Handling & Resilience

- **Implementation**:
  - Centralized error-handling middleware in the backend ensures consistent error responses.
  - Retry mechanisms are implemented for transient failures (e.g., database connection issues).

- **Patterns**:
  - Circuit breakers are used to prevent cascading failures.
  - Graceful degradation strategies ensure the application remains functional during partial outages.

## Logging & Monitoring

- **Implementation**:
  - Winston is used for structured logging in the backend.
  - Logs are categorized by severity levels (info, warn, error).

- **Patterns**:
  - Logs are centralized and monitored using external tools (e.g., ELK stack).
  - Alerts are configured for critical errors.

## Validation

- **Implementation**:
  - The `zod` library is used for schema validation.
  - Custom validation logic ensures business rules are enforced.

- **Patterns**:
  - Validation is performed at both the API boundary and the database layer.
  - Errors are propagated with detailed messages for debugging.

## Configuration Management

- **Implementation**:
  - Environment variables are used to manage configuration.
  - The `dotenv` library loads environment-specific configurations.

- **Patterns**:
  - Secrets are stored securely using a secrets management tool.
  - Feature flags are used to enable/disable functionality dynamically.

## Future Enhancements

- **Authentication**:
  - Implement OAuth2 for third-party integrations.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Add distributed tracing for better observability.

- **Validation**:
  - Introduce a validation framework for frontend forms.
