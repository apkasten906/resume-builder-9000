# Deployment Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment topology, runtime dependencies, and environment-specific adaptations for the `resume-builder-9000` project. The goal is to ensure reliable and scalable deployments across different environments.

## Deployment Topology

- **Frontend**:
  - Deployed as a static site using Next.js.
  - Hosted on a CDN (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) for fast global delivery.

- **Backend**:
  - Deployed as a Node.js application.
  - Hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

- **Database**:
  - SQLite database is used for simplicity.
  - Backups are automated and stored securely.

## Runtime Dependencies

- **Frontend**:
  - Requires Node.js for build-time rendering.
  - Uses environment variables for API endpoints.

- **Backend**:
  - Requires Node.js runtime.
  - Uses environment variables for database connections and secrets.

- **Database**:
  - Requires periodic maintenance for schema updates.
  - Backup scripts are scheduled to run daily.

## Environment-Specific Adaptations

- **Development**:
  - Uses a local SQLite database.
  - Runs on localhost with hot-reloading enabled.

- **Staging**:
  - Uses a separate SQLite instance for testing.
  - Deployed on a staging server for QA.

- **Production**:
  - Uses a production-grade SQLite setup with automated backups.
  - Deployed on a scalable cloud infrastructure.

## Best Practices

- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi) for consistent deployments.
- Automate deployments using CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor application performance and set up alerts for anomalies.
- Regularly review and update environment configurations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Frontend**:
  - Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic pages.

- **Backend**:
  - Add support for containerization using Docker.

- **Database**:
  - Migrate to a managed database service for better scalability.
