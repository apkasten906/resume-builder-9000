# Extension and Evolution Patterns

## Overview

This document provides guidance for extending and modifying the architecture of the `resume-builder-9000` project while maintaining its integrity. The goal is to ensure that the system remains scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to future requirements.

## General Principles

- **Modularity**:
  - Ensure that new features are implemented as independent modules.
  - Avoid tight coupling between components.

- **Backward Compatibility**:
  - Maintain compatibility with existing APIs and data structures.
  - Use versioning for breaking changes.

- **Consistency**:
  - Follow established coding standards and architectural patterns.
  - Ensure that new code integrates seamlessly with the existing system.

## Extending the Frontend

- **Adding New Pages**:
  - Create new files in the `src/pages` directory for routing.
  - Use feature-based components in `src/app` for modularity.

- **Introducing New Features**:
  - Implement reusable components for shared functionality.
  - Use the Context API or other state management solutions for global state.

- **Styling**:
  - Follow the Tailwind CSS conventions defined in `tailwind.config.js`.
  - Ensure responsive design using Tailwind's utilities.

## Extending the Backend

- **Adding New Endpoints**:
  - Define new routes in the `controllers` directory.
  - Implement business logic in the `services` directory.

- **Integrating New Services**:
  - Use the `utils` directory for shared utilities.
  - Ensure that new services follow the established patterns for dependency injection.

- **Database Changes**:
  - Update the SQLite schema with new tables or columns.
  - Write migration scripts to handle schema updates.

## Extending Shared Logic

- **Adding New Utilities**:
  - Implement new modules in the `core` package.
  - Ensure that utilities are generic and reusable.

- **Refactoring Core Logic**:
  - Refactor existing code to improve reusability and maintainability.
  - Write unit tests to validate changes.

## Evolution Patterns

- **Scaling the Frontend**:
  - Use server-side rendering (SSR) for performance-critical pages.
  - Implement lazy loading for large components.

- **Scaling the Backend**:
  - Introduce caching for frequently accessed data.
  - Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous processing.

- **Scaling the Database**:
  - Migrate to a managed database service for better scalability.
  - Implement read replicas for high availability.

## Best Practices

- Document all changes to the architecture.
- Write tests for new features and refactored code.
- Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to standards.
- Regularly review and update the architecture to address technical debt.

## Future Enhancements

- **Frontend**:
  - Introduce a design system for consistent UI components.

- **Backend**:
  - Add support for GraphQL to improve API flexibility.

- **Database**:
  - Implement database sharding for horizontal scaling.
