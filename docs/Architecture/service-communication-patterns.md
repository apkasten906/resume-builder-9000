# Service Communication Patterns

## Overview

This document outlines the communication patterns used between services in the `resume-builder-9000` project. It highlights the protocols, data formats, and resilience strategies employed to ensure reliable and efficient communication.

## Communication Protocols

- **HTTP/REST**:
  - Used for communication between the frontend and backend.
  - Endpoints are designed following RESTful principles.

- **WebSockets**:
  - Used for real-time updates (e.g., live preview of resume changes).

## Data Formats

- **JSON**:
  - Primary data format for API communication.
  - Ensures lightweight and human-readable data exchange.

- **Validation**:
  - All incoming and outgoing data is validated using `zod` schemas.

## Resilience Patterns

- **Retry Mechanisms**:
  - Automatic retries are implemented for transient failures (e.g., network issues).

- **Circuit Breakers**:
  - Prevent cascading failures by halting requests to failing services temporarily.

- **Timeouts**:
  - All service calls have timeouts to avoid indefinite waiting.

- **Fallbacks**:
  - Default responses are provided when a service is unavailable.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**:
  - All API calls require a valid JWT for authentication.

- **Encryption**:
  - Data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS.

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per user.

## Future Enhancements

- **gRPC**:
  - Evaluate the use of gRPC for internal service communication to improve performance.

- **Message Queues**:
  - Introduce message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication.

- **Service Discovery**:
  - Implement service discovery mechanisms for dynamic endpoint resolution.
