# ADR 3: Next.js for Frontend

## Context

The frontend requires server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities for improved SEO and performance. The framework should also support modern development practices and integrate well with the backend.

## Decision

Use Next.js for the frontend application. Next.js provides SSR, static site generation (SSG), and a rich ecosystem for modern web development.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Improved SEO, better performance, and a modern development experience.
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in deployment and potential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Next.js.
