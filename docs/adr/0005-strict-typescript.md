# ADR 5: Enforce Strict TypeScript Types and Type Safety

## Context

During Copilot code review and architectural discussions, it became clear that enforcing strict type safety in TypeScript would significantly improve maintainability, reliability, and developer experience. Type safety helps catch errors early, improves code readability, and enables better tooling and refactoring support. Copilot review specifically recommended true types and strict type annotations across the codebase.

## Decision

Adopt strict TypeScript type enforcement throughout the codebase. All modules, functions, and APIs must use explicit and accurate type annotations. The TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) is set to strict mode, and CI checks will fail if type errors are present.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Improved code quality, fewer runtime errors, better IDE/tooling support, easier refactoring, and more robust APIs.
- **Negative**: Slightly increased development overhead, stricter CI, and a learning curve for developers less familiar with advanced TypeScript features.
