# Unit Tests for Resume Database Operations

Unit tests have been implemented for the resume database operations in the `db.ts` file. These tests cover:

1. **getAllResumesFromDb**
   - ✅ Should return all resumes from the database
   - ✅ Should handle database errors gracefully

2. **getResumeFromDb**
   - ✅ Should return a single resume by ID
   - ✅ Should return null for non-existent resume ID
   - ✅ Should handle database errors gracefully

3. **insertResume**
   - ✅ Should insert a resume and return the generated ID
   - ✅ Should handle database errors during insert gracefully

## Implementation Notes

- The tests use mocking of the better-sqlite3 dependency to simulate database responses and errors
- For the normal cases, we verify the correct data processing and return values
- For the error cases, we verify that errors are properly thrown
- We've properly typed the mock data to match the expected interfaces

## Type Issues Fixed

- Used proper types for `ResumeData` and `JobDetails` interfaces
- Made sure mock data matched the requirements of the interfaces
- Fixed import issues and used proper ES module imports

## Next Steps

- Add integration tests for resume database operations
- Consider refactoring resume database operations into a repository pattern similar to applications
